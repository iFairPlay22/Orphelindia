The orphan cause is particularly close to my heart because my father has been an orphan himself. since he was a child, he had to learn quickly to fend for himself and to miss several years of school for lack of means. He often told me that if he had had someone to push him to go far and study for a long time, he would surely have succeeded even better than he does today. Even though I am proud of everything he has achieved and the path he has taken, I took his words into consideration. So, today I want to be one of the people who will push these children to do their best. but also a person who can give them a taste for school and education, which is, in my opinion, the driving pillar of our society. Education is the most important thing in a child's life, it is a chance that can allow Them to build Their own future."
